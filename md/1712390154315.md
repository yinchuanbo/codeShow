  >Explain how financial intermediation exposes banks to risk and explain what
  those risks are.</i
><br /><br />Financial <del>intermission</del> <ins>intermediation</ins>involves
asset transformation <del>wherepie</del> whereby intermediares mismatch the
liabilities owed and assets owned in terms of duration, size and liquidity. This
mismatch leads to the intermediary facing several types of risk: interest rate
risk, <del>market risk</del>, credit risk and liquidity risk. Two other risks
faced by a bank <ins>are</ins>market risk and operational risk but these simply
result from trading <ins>and operating</ins>.<br />Interest rate risk has two
effects: the market effect and the income effect. Only the income effect results
<ins>from</ins>financial intermediation, which is further broken down into two
scenarios: the assets of a bank having a greater duration than its
<del>assets</del> <ins>liabilities</ins>or the the liabilities of a bank having
a greater duration than its assets. The former results in
<del>repotato-ing risk</del> reinvestment risk which is the risk that assets
(loans) may be re-invested at a rate <del>higher</del> <ins>lower</ins>than
existing liabilities (deposits). The latter results in refinancing risk which is
just the opposite.<br />Credit risk is the risk that a <del>loan</del> borrower
defaults and that none <ins>or only a part</ins>of the banks liabilities are
recouped.<br />Liquidity risk is the risk arising from a mismatch in
<del>socks</del> <ins>duration</ins>. It is the risk that a bank is not able to
liquidify its assets in time to pay its liabilities and
<del>will definetely</del> may default.
